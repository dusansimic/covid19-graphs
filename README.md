# Covid-19 Graphs

Website: [covid19.dusansimic.me](http://covid19.dusansimic.me)

This is a small, quick and dirty light web app that I made. My mom who is a medical specialist wanted to see graphs with numbers of Corona virus victims in each country for the past cuple of weeks. There are some sites where you can get that but not for all countries as I've seen. Since it was good for my mom and me I wanted to share it so anyone can check it out.

## Data source

All of the data You see here is from [this](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) GitHub repository. It's created by Center for Systems Science and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University. You can see all the information about the data sources on that link.
The data is now always up to date because it's updated once at midnight (23:59h) but it's reliable and could be used for relative representation of the Corona virus situation around the world.
